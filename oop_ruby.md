### What is OOP?

Object Oriented Programming(OOP) is a programming paradigm that organizes data in objects.  These objects can have attributes and methods to define what they are and how they behave.

        <li>Scalabity of your application</li>
        <li>Makes your code efficient and resuable</li>
    </ul>
